## Welcome to the Junior Backend Development Course Playground! 🎉

This is where the magic of backend development begins.
Think of this file as your canvas for experimenting with code.

👉 What you'll find here:
 - A simple HTTP server written in TypeScript
 - The starting point for creating your own backend logic

🛠️ Feel free to tweak the code, break things (and fix them), and explore how everything works. Backend development is all about learning through experimentation!

🚀 Let's build something awesome together!
